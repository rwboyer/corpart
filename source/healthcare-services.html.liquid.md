### New Healthcare

Healthcare In the United States is in the midst of radical changes. Major advances in technology have changed the face of medical services delivery. Government policies have forced healthcare institutions to adjust to the pressures of a new fiscal reality. And patient care has been changed by technology-driven consumerism. 

Yet one aspect of health care has not changed, and that is the unwavering commitment by healthcare professionals to best practices in patient care. Healing the patient - promoting the best health outcomes - remains the defining motivation of health care professionals.


### Emerging Research

So focused has medicine been on the patient’s illness, little attention until recently has been paid to the treatment environment itself. Now emerging research clearly demonstrates that patient outcomes are improved, in some cases significantly, by attending to the surroundings in which health care is administered. The addition of visual art can help reduce stress for patients and increase satisfaction with care. 3

Art, specifically nature art, is a safe, inexpensive method that may reduce pain during painful and invasive medical procedures. 1,2

In juried medical journals, researchers report that patients exposed to nature images experience less post-operative anxiety and are more likely to switch to weaker painkillers than control groups. 4

Nature images reduce anxiety, improve feelings of well-being, and increase positive patient outcomes. They also help calm restless behavior and noise levels in emergency department waiting rooms. 5

Emerging research confirms and even extends the benefits reported by the presence of nature imagery in health care settings, whether doctor's offices, clinics or hospitals.

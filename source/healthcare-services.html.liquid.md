## Purpose Imagery
In some cases, our clients require customized images. Perhaps a medical rehabilitation facility needs images of specific locations to help patients adjust to the outside world. Or a corporate client requires images of their new campus. Or a nonprofit organization wants images of the children it serves. We pride ourselves in being able to deliver complex images with visual punch. We aim for a WOW! factor in all our imagery.

### New Healthcare

Healthcare In the United States is in the midst of radical changes. Major advances in technology have changed the face of medical services delivery. Government policies have forced healthcare institutions to adjust to the pressures of a new fiscal reality. And patient care has been changed by technology-driven consumerism. 

Yet one aspect of health care has not changed, and that is the unwavering commitment by healthcare professionals to best practices in patient care. Healing the patient - promoting the best health outcomes - remains the defining motivation of health care professionals. 


### Emerging Research

So focused has medicine been on the patient’s illness, little attention until recently has been paid to the treatment environment itself. Now emerging research clearly demonstrates that patient outcomes are improved, in some cases significantly, by attending to the surroundings in which health care is administered, reducing anxiety, improving feelings of well-being, and increasing positive patient outcomes.

In juried medical journals, researchers have found that:

> "Viewing a nature scene… is a safe, inexpensive method that may reduce pain during (high pain medical procedures)." Further the investigators state: "This approach should be considered to alleviate pain during invasive procedures." 1

> "Distraction therapy withy nature sights… significantly reduces pain in patients undergoing (painful medical procedure). Clinicians should consider this noninvasive strategy in addition to standard analgesic medications in patients undergoing painful, invasive procedures." 2

Visual art can help reduce stress for patients and increase satisfaction with care. 3

Patients exposed to a nature image experience less post-operative anxiety and are more likely to switch to weaker painkillers than control groups. 4

Nature images  helped calm restless behavior and noise levels in two Texas emergency department waiting rooms. 5

Other research confirms these findings.

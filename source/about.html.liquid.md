### Les Picker

Les Picker has been photographing since the age of 11. Les has since photographed for National Geographic Society publications and many other consumer and corporate magazines and newspapers. He has had more than 650 published works in major national publications. He was a monthly columnist and features contributor to Oceans Magazine and a weekly columnist, Op-Ed contributor and features travel writer and photographer for The Baltimore Sun. 

Two characteristics shape Les’ photography; passion and inquisitiveness. He has an earned doctorate in ecology, which he believes helps inform his landscape and wildlife photography. His interest in other cultures draws him frequently to exotic locales. 

Les was named Best Travel Photographer for the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award. He is in demand as a keynote speaker, lecturer and judge for photography competitions.  

“I feel blessed to be able to write and photograph for a living,” Les says. “If my photographs help people better appreciate our natural world – and its fragility – then I feel I have accomplished a worthy life goal.”

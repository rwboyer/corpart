Today we are releasing a video showcasing our work with health care facilities. As a professional photographer, I have to say that few things are as rewarding as knowing your images are helping people to heal.

A growing body of scientific literature clearly shows that patient health outcomes improve markedly when they are exposed to comforting images of our natural world during their treatment. That holds true whether in long-term care or in emergency settings. Health care treatment is often riddled with anxiety. Patients enter with troubling symptoms to begin with and these problems are exacerbated by the sterile atmosphere, bright lights and the anxiety of anticipating painful procedures.

But what if we can change that dynamic? What if we can tailor the patient's environment to minimize that anxiety? Is it even possible to accelerate the healing process through art?

The answer is that we can do all of that and more. The entire field of health facility construction and decorating has been aided by research into evidence-based design, which clearly shows that nature images decrease patient anxiety and maximize healing. 
Health care facilities are increasingly realizing the benefits of these patient-centered approaches. 

Two years ago I was called into a major teaching hospital in Baltimore -- Sinai Hospital -- to help them design a very special new wing for patients with traumatic brain injuries. Working with an absolutely wonderful, dedicated staff, led by Dr. Scott Brown, we developed patient spaces that would utilize my images to help patients - and their families- heal more quickly from these devastating injuries. 

We also worked with Dr. Rafael Tamargo and the Neurosurgery Department at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions to include artwork into their patient environment. In the video the staff of the cerebrovascular neurosurgery department talk about the reactions of staff and patients to the art-enhanced environment.  

We would be happy to consult with your health care facility to bring healing nature art into your patient settings. Please give a call to Dr. Les Picker to discuss how we can become part of your health care design team. Les' direct number is: (443) 417-6539.
